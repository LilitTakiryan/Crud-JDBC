# Crud-JDBC
The goal of this project is to work with SQL database by using GUI. As shown in the screenshot there are 3 fields available. 
1. For creating a row,
2. For updating the row,
3. For deleting the row.

We only need to fill the fields in creating mode.
To update the row firstly we should write the id of that row and click getID after which we can do the appropriate changes and click update.
To delete the row we only need its id.
